Accesses are based on Categories.

- For app Administrator:
		We have Administrator role which can do anything.

- For category Admins:
		Each Category has admin to manage its books, add or update or delete them.
		This will handle by set AdminRole for each category by Adminstrator. The role should be mached
		from the one created in Security project. (Important)

- For viewers:
		Originallly the senario was each Category to have special viewers, meaning only athorized users can see Category and related books.
		but in development progress, I decided to not implement it, because it is not right by bussiness and also will complex 
		and needs in-app tables to implement (security not handle
		the units accessibility), so I ignored it. 

		> View Categories are based on Units, so cannot be configured in ATA Security. (Security is only for Users).
		It is this project business and should be handled here. (Update: not needed anymore)
