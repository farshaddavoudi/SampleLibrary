Accesses are based on Categories.

Each Category has admin to manage its books, add or update or delete them.

Each Category has special viewers, meaning only athorized users can see Category and related books.

View Categories are based on Units, so cannot be configured in ATA Security. (Security is only for Users). It is this project business and should be handled here.

Sometimes system administrator should be able to access all users to see all books.
