Description:
	- Due to being in a hurry, I instructed to developed system very fast. 
	- So I decided to make the system work just for basic stuff, seeing books! and also add and edit and delete books for administrator.

Schedule:
	- 2 days for infrastructure:
		> Project extra analysis 
		> Design a properiate architecture
		> Create project structure in VisualStudio (backend & frontend)
		> Configure git and adding project to git
		> Configure SSO for project in security.app.ataair.ir
		> Also adding the database (without tables)

	- 2 days for business logic (backend development):
		> Adding tables, services, controllers and approperiate endpoints
		> R&D for image and file uploads on file system, then implement it

	- 2 days for frontend development:
		> Think about pages design
		> Creating those designs by html/css
		> Connect frontend to backend and make app dynamic

	- 1 day for publish / test 
		> Configure DNS and IIS and VS to publish app to the server (frontend & backend)
		> Test and fix apperance and logic bugs based on manual tests and owner comments		


Important notes: 
	- Every day in ATA is around 6 hours.
	- Other time-consuming (irrelavant) works between the development may cause deferring the schedule.
	- New ideas/features for this phase by owner may cause extra time.
